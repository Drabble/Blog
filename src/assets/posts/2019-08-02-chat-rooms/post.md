Chatrooms is a Node.js-based web application designed to facilitate both audio and text-based chat rooms. The application leverages PeerJS to establish a Peer-to-Peer network, incorporating WebRTC for real-time communication and handling NAT traversal challenges. Additionally, a TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) and STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) server are employed to ensure seamless communication.

## Key Components:

- **Node.js Backend:**
  Chatrooms is powered by Node.js, providing a scalable and event-driven backend for handling communication, user interactions, and the management of chat rooms. Node.js facilitates efficient handling of concurrent connections in real-time.

- **PeerJS for Peer-to-Peer Communication:**
  PeerJS is utilized to establish a Peer-to-Peer network for direct communication between users. This framework simplifies the integration of WebRTC and aids in creating a seamless and efficient audio and text chat experience.

- **WebRTC for Real-Time Communication:**
  WebRTC forms the backbone of real-time communication in Chatrooms. It enables direct communication between users' web browsers, supporting both audio and text-based interactions within the chat rooms.

- **TURN + STUN Server:**
  To overcome NAT traversal challenges and ensure connectivity between peers, Chatrooms incorporates a TURN server for relaying media streams and a STUN server for discovering public IP addresses. This combination helps establish direct communication channels between users.

## Functionality:

Chatrooms provide users with the capability to create and join audio and text chat rooms dynamically. The Peer-to-Peer network enables direct communication between participants, creating a decentralized and responsive chat experience.

## How to Use:

While the technical details of Chatrooms' source code are not explicitly provided, the application itself can be explored to understand the implementation of audio and text chat rooms using Node.js, PeerJS, and WebRTC.

In summary, Chatrooms is a Node.js web application that showcases the integration of PeerJS, WebRTC, and TURN + STUN servers to create a robust and efficient platform for audio and text-based chat rooms.
