A boost pedal for a guitar increases the strength of the audio signal, providing a volume boost for solos or enhancing overall signal strength. It works by using a transistor-based circuit to amplify the input signal, boosting the amplitude without introducing significant distortion. The pedal typically includes controls for adjusting the level of boost, allowing the guitarist to tailor the intensity of the volume increase. It is often used to push an amplifier into overdrive, add sustain, or lift the guitar's signal in a mix.

I tried to use one of the most basic circuits with a single transistor to make my own boost pedal. I used an old case of sweets I found lying around for the case. As you can see in the image below, it is very similar to my other [distortion pedal](/post/2016-10-11-distortion-pedal)

This is the build result. Unfortunately I didn't make any recording of the output of the pedal.
