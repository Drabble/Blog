    "description": "I took on the challenge of creating a game called Survival. This project had a simple yet engaging premise: players would dive into a survival experience, tasked with building their civilization. The gameplay focused on strategic decision-making, resource management, and the gradual development of a flourishing society within a dynamic environment. Although the visuals were kept straightforward, the goal was to deliver an immersive and captivating experience, allowing players to explore the intricacies of survival and civilization-building.",
