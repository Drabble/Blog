    "description": "Chain of Invincibility is a command line-based fighting simulation game developed for a school project, strategically designed to showcase the application of the chain of responsibility design pattern. The chain of responsibility design pattern is a behavioral pattern where a request passes through a chain of handlers, each capable of processing or delegating the request. This pattern promotes loose coupling and flexibility in handling requests.",
