Keep in touch is a chat application for Android. It comprises an Android application made with Android Studio and a Scala backend written with the Play framework.

My focus was on the Android application and a colleague took care of the backend.

In order to keep a bidirectional connection to send new messages and notifications, we used long polling. Long polling is a web communication technique used to achieve real-time updates or push notifications from a server to a client over the HTTP protocol. Unlike traditional polling, where the client repeatedly sends requests to the server at fixed intervals, long polling allows the server to hold a request open until new data is available. 

We added some features such as groups and notifications.
