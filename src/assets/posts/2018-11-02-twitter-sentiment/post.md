We used the Twitter API to retrieve all the tweets related to a specific crypto. We then analyze the sentiment of each of these tweets and ponder them based on multiple criterias. This gives us a total score in real time that we can correllate with the crypto real time price. We then plot all of this data in real time with Python.
