The technical foundation of this app involves the integration of a WebAssembly (WASM) Rust library, which computes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using the Harmonic Product Spectrum technique. Additionally, a dynamic SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) generator is employed to create and update guitar tabs in real-time.",
