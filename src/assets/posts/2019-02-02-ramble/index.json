    "description": "Ramble is a project I worked on alone for my master degree at the university. My goal was to fully create, from music, to 3d models, to programming, a Multiplayer Online game based on League of Legends and DOTA but with a different twist. The goal of the game is to work with your team to push a cart on the other side of the map by capturing strategic outposts.",
