I have managed the Yadlo Festival website for over 2 years. Yadlo is a free festival held at the Pr√©verenges beach on the shores of Lake Leman. The website is a static site developed with a custom Content Management System (CMS), and it features an integrated shop powered by WooCommerce.

## Festival Details:

- **Event Information:**
  The website serves as a central hub for providing detailed information about the Yadlo Festival, including dates, location, and any other relevant details for attendees.

- **Shop Section:**
  The integrated shop allows festival organizers to sell tickets, merchandise, or any other items related to the event. WooCommerce ensures a secure and user-friendly e-commerce experience for visitors.
