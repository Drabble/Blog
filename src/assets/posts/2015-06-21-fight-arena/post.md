After giving Unity a go, I decided to explore Unreal Engine. It shares similarities with Unity but brings its own flavor by incorporating both C++ and blueprints. 

Blueprints, a visual scripting system, caught my attention. It allows you to code by connecting nodes, offering a more visual and intuitive approach.

In my experimentation with Unreal Engine, I ventured into creating a simple local gameâ€”a fight arena inspired by games like Dragon Ball. However, I didn't go far with this project.
