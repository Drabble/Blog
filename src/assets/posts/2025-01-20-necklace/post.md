So I needed to make a gift and decided on a necklace because I had a rock lying around that we recently got in the USA while travelling.

I first started with some prototypes. I took two rocks that I had in my rocks collection when I was a kid.

For the first one I tried to drill a hole with a diamond bit and using a 1mm copper wire I made a hook.

I was not a huge fan of how it looked and the chain didn't match the copper.

Then I made a second test with another nicer rock. For this one I glued a hook with some epoxy resin. This one I had to grind a bit with a grindstone for knifes.

Then I got working on the real stone. It was unakite that we got in Virginia. It looked a bit like this one:

I had to carve it a lot. All I had was grindstones for knifes. It was long...

After that I glued it the same way with epoxy resin, added a silver chain and it was done :)
