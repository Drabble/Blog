I learned how to use Unity and made my first game with it. You control a blue ball and you need to reach the green square. If you fall out or if you touch the red square you lose. There are a few levels of increasing difficulty.

I used Unity's built-in physics engine to make my game more dynamic. It handles things like how the ball rolls, responds to gravity, and interacts with the environment. 

Unity makes game creation easy by letting you build your game bit by bit. It breaks down the process into smaller pieces, so you can focus on one thing at a time. Whether you're working on levels, how things move, or making things happen in the game, Unity's step-by-step approach makes it doable.
