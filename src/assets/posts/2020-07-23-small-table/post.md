I needed a small table for my living room. I found a nice table on an online shop but it was very expensive. I figured that I could build it for cheaper, even including the price of a stick welder. So I bought the welder and learned how weld by watching youtube videos. It is surprisingly easy to get started and very hard to do well.

Here are some of my first welds.

*My first welds*

I decided to grind them smooth for two reasons. First it is easier to make sure that my weld are good and second it is cleaner for the final build and exterior edges.

Then I worked on welding everything together.
