A casual multiplayer game where the central concept revolves around players collaboratively flying a plane by dynamically jumping onto and moving along its wings. The game incorporates procedural terrain generation to create an expansive and ever-changing environment, providing an infinite map for players to explore.

The core gameplay mechanic involves players influencing the direction of the plane by strategically positioning themselves on its wings. Each player's movement along the wings directly affects the plane's orientation, allowing for collaborative steering. This unique control scheme encourages teamwork and coordination among players as they navigate through the dynamically generated terrain.
