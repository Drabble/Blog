    "description": "I was bored and I had seen some photos of cigar box guitars online. So I went into my cellar, found some scrap wood and put it together into something resembling a guitar. Then I ordered the cheapest pickup and guitar pegs. It worked however I didn't have any fret on this guitar and I didn't have a bottletneck. So I took a bottle of wine, broke it and used the neck as a bottleneck. I later found out that there are better ways to cut it cleanly with hot and cold water.",
