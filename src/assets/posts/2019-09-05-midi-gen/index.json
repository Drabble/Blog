    "description": "I have always been interested in making music. However it is not an easy task. You often learn by first listening and playing music from other people. Then you can adapt what they did by adding your own twist or a fusion between multiple other songs. A change in the key, a different melody, different instruments, a different rythm, different lyrics, etc. There are so many possibilities.",
