The Settlers of Catan is one of my all time favourite game. One night I wanted to craft something and thought about this. After looking at the list of pieces online, I realised it would be very easy to make a minimal version of it so I could play it with friends the next day. It was a fun little project and we have made many games of Settlers of Catan since using this build.
