    "description": "As part of my master's project, I focused on an innovative approach to phobia treatment using virtual reality. The project incorporated various scenes targeting specific phobias, such as plane phobia, height phobia, and spider phobia. A unique feature included the ability for users to teleport to designated safe zones within the virtual environment, offering a sense of control and safety.",
