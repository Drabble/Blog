As part of my master's project, I focused on an innovative approach to phobia treatment using virtual reality. The project incorporated various scenes targeting specific phobias, such as plane phobia, height phobia, and spider phobia. A unique feature included the ability for users to teleport to designated safe zones within the virtual environment, offering a sense of control and safety.

To enhance the calming experience, users could put on soothing music within the virtual space. The project also featured an introductory scene to familiarize users with VR interactions, allowing them to touch virtual items.

The primary goal was to integrate therapeutic activities directly into the phobia environments, unrelated to the specific phobia. Users engaged in tasks like gathering items, answering quizzes, and capturing virtual spiders. This approach aimed to gradually desensitize individuals to their phobias by associating positive activities with the feared environments. The use of virtual reality provided an immersive and controlled setting for effective phobia treatment.
