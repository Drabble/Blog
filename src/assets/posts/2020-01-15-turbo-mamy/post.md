"Turbo Mamy" is the result of a 24-hour game jam during the 2020 Orbital Game Jam 3, created in collaboration with two friends. Despite the time constraints, we crafted a fully functional game featuring multiple levels and a conclusive ending. Additionally, I contributed two original songs to enhance the game's atmosphere.

Enjoy the fast-paced adventure and creative energy poured into "Turbo Mamy," a testament to the exciting possibilities that can emerge from a dynamic game jam setting.
