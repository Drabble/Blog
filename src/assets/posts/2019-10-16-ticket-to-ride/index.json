    "description": "After making Settlers of Catan I wanted to make another game. I found that ticket to ride might be a good match however I didn't know how to make the map out of something durable. I could have printed it on paper but it would not be very strong. Then I thought about transfering ink from a printer onto wood. I quickly found on the internet that you can use acetone to transfer the ink from paper to wood. After scaling the map to print on multiple papers and flipping it, I applied it to the wood. It looked good but as good as I wanted to I retouched some parts of it with colour pencils. Then I finished it with some lacquer.",
