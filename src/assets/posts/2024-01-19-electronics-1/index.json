    "description": "Electronics is based on one of the 4 fundamental forces, electromagnetism. Electromagnetism is the interaction between electric charges and currents, as well as their associated magnetic fields. It encompasses phenomena such as the generation of magnetic fields by electric currents, the induction of electric currents by changing magnetic fields, and the fundamental relationship described by Maxwell's equations. Let's define some words.",
