Here is a sample SQL script to create a basic database for storing audio tracks and user information.

```sql
-- Create Opensound Database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS opensound;

-- Use Opensound Database
USE opensound;

-- Create Users Table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- Create Audio Tracks Table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS audio_tracks (
    track_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    file_path VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    upload_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);

-- Sample Data for Users
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES
    ('user1', 'user1@example.com', 'hashed_password_1'),
    ('user2', 'user2@example.com', 'hashed_password_2');

-- Sample Data for Audio Tracks
INSERT INTO audio_tracks (user_id, title, file_path) VALUES
    (1, 'Track 1', 'path/to/track1.mp3'),
    (2, 'Track 2', 'path/to/track2.mp3');
```
