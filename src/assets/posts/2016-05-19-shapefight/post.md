Shapefight, a web-based game, immerses players in dynamic multiplayer arenas accessed via Websockets. Begin your journey with a basic fighter equipped with a single-shot gun firing once per second. Progress unfolds as power-ups enhance your fighter, and defeating opponents yields valuable bonuses. 

Inspired by multiplayer web-based classics like slither.io and agar.io, Shapefight introduces a captivating twist to the genre.
