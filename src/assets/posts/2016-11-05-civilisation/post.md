As a follow-up on my previous prototype, <a href="/post/2016-10-22-tower-defense">Tower Defense</a>, I thought it would be a good idea to explore the idea of agents. Small independant agents that will work kind of like ants by trying to fetch resources and follow pheromones dropped by other agents.

I integrated a day/night cycle and some post processing effects to make the game more interesting, similarly to what I did in the Tower Defense game.
