Interested by the stock market, I decided to create a fun trading game using Java and Android Studio. In this simulation, real-time events pop up, and players must decide how these news pieces will affect stock values. The game mirrors the unpredictability of the financial market, providing a strategic challenge. To add a touch of realism, I wanted to integrate real-world news, impacting the game in real-time. It's a simple yet engaging experience where players make decisions, experiencing the highs and lows of stock trading in a dynamic, mobile-friendly format.
