I picked up C and dived into the world of 2D game development using the SDL library. For practice, I decided to create a simple clone of Super Mario Bros The goal was less about crafting a masterpiece and more about improving my coding skills and getting a taste of game development.

SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is a powerful cross-platform development library written in C. It provides low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, and display functionalities, making it a popular choice for game developers and multimedia applications. In the context of my project, leveraging SDL allowed me to efficiently handle 2D graphics and user input, offering a solid foundation for building a Super Mario Bros clone. The simplicity and versatility of SDL, combined with the procedural nature of C, provided a practical environment for me to learn the fundamentals of game development.

The game included a few levels as well as mushrooms, traps, music and sound effects.

Make sure you check out the source code on Github. It is only the second project I have created on Github [https://github.com/Drabble/SuperMario](https://github.com/Drabble/SuperMario).
