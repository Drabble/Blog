Pill Notifier is an application designed to remind users to take their medications at scheduled times. Addressing prevalent issues with notification systems in existing applications of a similar nature, I developed this app to offer a reliable and effective solution. Notably, my girlfriend used this application for several years, attesting to its practicality and success in facilitating medication adherence.
