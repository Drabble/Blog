Apache Baremaps is an open source toolkit and a set of infrastructure components for creating, publishing, and operating online maps. It provides a data pipeline enabling developers to build maps with different data sources. It offers live reload capabilities that allow cartographers to customize the content and the style of a map. It includes an attribution-free map schema and style that stimulates derived work. Finally, it provides services commonly used in online maps, such as location search and IP to location.

**My part in Baremaps**

During my work at HEIG-VD, I had the chance to work with Bertil Chapuis. He is the founder of Baremaps and a great mentor for me. He gave me the chance to take a part in the development of Baremaps. To discuss on various architectural topics and to develop some components such as the IP to location and Geocoding features.

**Apache foundation**

After many years of development, Bertil took the opportunity to put Baremaps in the Apache foundation to ensure it's future development and to grow a community around the project. As a committer I had the chance to become a member of the Apache foundation and to take part into the incubation process.
