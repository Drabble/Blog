    "description": "I had broken skateboards lying around and I wanted to make another guitar. It is hard to find hard wood in Switzerland for cheap and I didn't want to make another guitar out of pine. I glued the skateboards together, got myself a handeld router and carved out the holes for the guitar parts to be put into.",
