Following the [cigar box guitar](/post/2016-07-30-cigar-box), I had broken skateboards lying around and I wanted to make another guitar. It is hard to find hard wood in Switzerland for cheap and I didn't want to make another guitar out of pine. I glued the skateboards together, got myself a handeld router and carved out the holes for the guitar parts to be put into.

My big mistake was to think I could simply make a neck out of cheap wood. I learned a valuable lesson this day. It is not easy to make a neck, you need the base of the neck to be strong and comfortable to hold, you need truss rod to be able to adjust the neck and you need a proper fretboard to glue on top.

It is always great to learn from mistakes, and it is always great to experiment.
