I needed a variable alimentation to make some test for projects. I also wanted to be able to use aligator clips for quick testing and measure the voltage/amperage. I got that [buck/boost dc/dc module](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/32870436892.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.399.6edd5e5brbXlvR&gatewayAdapt=glo2fra) that I wired inside. I also got a voltmeter/ampermeter that you can see in the image below.
