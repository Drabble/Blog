Oak Chat is a secure and privacy-focused chat web application developed using Node.js and Socket.io. This technical powerhouse ensures real-time communication with an added layer of encryption, offering users a private and reliable messaging experience.

## Key Technical Features:

1. **Node.js Backend:**
   Oak Chat harnesses the power of Node.js on the backend, providing a scalable and efficient server environment. This JavaScript runtime allows for asynchronous, event-driven architecture, making it ideal for real-time applications like chat.

2. **Socket.io for Real-Time Communication:**
   At the core of Oak Chat's real-time functionality is Socket.io. This library enables bidirectional communication between the server and clients in real-time. Whether it's instant messaging or updates to the chat interface, Socket.io ensures seamless and responsive communication.

3. **Encryption for Privacy:**
   Security is paramount in Oak Chat. The application incorporates encryption techniques to safeguard user messages and data during transit. This additional layer of protection ensures that conversations remain confidential, adding an extra level of privacy for users.

## Sample Socket.io Code:

```javascript
// Server-side code using Node.js and Socket.io
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const socketIo = require('socket.io');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketIo(server);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('A user connected');

  // Listen for incoming messages
  socket.on('message', (data) => {
    // Broadcast the message to all connected clients
    io.emit('message', data);
  });

  // Handle disconnection
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('User disconnected');
  });
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```
