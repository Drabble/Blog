I participated in the Game Incubator, an event organized by a close friend. The objective was to collaboratively develop a game within a tight timeframe, with a diverse team of around 15 people including developers, 3D artists, musicians, and more. My role involved providing assistance across various tasks and facilitating communication among team members.

Together, we crafted a straightforward local multiplayer game where players select characters and engage in battles on a compact map. Each character boasts a unique set of skills, adding an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay. It was an intense but rewarding experience, highlighting the power of teamwork and creativity in bringing a game to life in just two days.
