This year we participated again to the Ludum Dare with some friends. I was working on a Midi project at the time
and figured we could take advantage of this.

The idea was that I would write music in a DAW. Then export everything as midi. We could then load midi file into Unity fairly easily with
a library.

Then we found a theme and a way to make it funny. We made three levels of increasing difficulty. We even got a review of someone that took the time to record of 1 hour video of him playing.
