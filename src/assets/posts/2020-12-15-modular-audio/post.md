Modular Audio is a technical project initiated to develop a web-based modular synthesizer application. The aim is to create a versatile and interactive platform that allows users to experiment with modular audio synthesis directly within their web browsers.

## Key Components:

- **Web-Based Platform:**
  *Modular Audio* is designed as a web application, providing users with accessibility and the convenience of experimenting with modular synthesis without the need for specialized hardware. This platform harnesses the capabilities of web technologies to offer a seamless and interactive user experience.

- **Modular Synthesis Concept:**
  The core concept revolves around modular synthesis, allowing users to assemble and connect virtual modules to create complex audio signal chains. This approach offers a high degree of flexibility, enabling users to explore diverse soundscapes by combining various modules.

## Functionality:

*Modular Audio* aims to replicate the experience of working with physical modular synthesizers but in a digital environment. Users can expect features such as module selection, patch cable connections, parameter adjustments, and real-time audio output. The modular nature allows for a wide range of sonic possibilities.

## Development Approach:

The technical development of *Modular Audio* involves implementing modular synthesizer components using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application may incorporate frameworks or libraries for audio processing, interactivity, and user interface design, providing a cohesive and efficient development environment.
