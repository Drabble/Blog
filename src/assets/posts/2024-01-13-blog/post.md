This blog/portfolio has been through so many versions that I have lost count. 

In 2011 I was looking for a new project idea and I decided that making a Portfolio would be a good idea, so I created the V1 of this website as you can see in the image below.

*Version 1*

Then over the years I made more than 7 new versions of the blog. Each year I would get bored with the current look of the blog and I would update it.

*Versions 2 to 7*

I have hosted the website for free all this time. In the first days I had subscribed to a free account on [https://cuccfree.com/](https://cuccfree.com/). I would upload the website over HTTP. Later I moved the website to Heroku, then to Github pages and I used VueJS to generate a static build of the website.

The latest version is written with Angular and Typescript. It is hosted on Vercel. The Vercel integration is flawless and I can only recommend it. I configured it with at most 3 clicks and each time I commit, the website is regenerated and hosted for free on Vercel with Server Side Rendering. I also use Static Site Generation to improve the performances.

Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) are two approaches to web development that address the challenge of delivering dynamic content while optimizing performance.

Static Site Generation involves pre-rendering the web pages at build time, generating static HTML files that can be served directly to users. This approach enhances website speed and reduces server load, as the content is already prepared in advance. Popular SSG frameworks like Next.js or Gatsby have gained traction for their ability to create fast, SEO-friendly websites.

On the other hand, Server-Side Rendering involves rendering web pages on the server dynamically at the time of the request. This allows for the inclusion of real-time data and dynamic content tailored to each user. SSR is often associated with frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt.js, providing a balance between dynamic content and optimal performance.

While SSG excels in delivering fast and scalable websites with reduced server load, SSR shines in scenarios where up-to-the-minute data or personalized content is crucial. Choosing between SSG and SSR depends on the specific requirements of a project, balancing the need for dynamic content with the desire for optimal performance and user experience.
