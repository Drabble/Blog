    "description": "During my master's degree in game design, our team developed Thorn, an engaging 2D shooter game as part of a game design course. The game comprises multiple levels, each escalating in difficulty. The primary objective is survivalâ€”players must endure waves of zombie spawns and eliminate them to progress. A unique twist lies in the bonuses dropped by defeated zombies, providing crucial aid for survival.",
