Battleship is a multiplayer web-based game that brings the classic naval warfare game to the digital realm. Developed with a technical stack that includes JavaScript, Socket.io, and Express for the backend, along with a Python watchdog to ensure continuous operation and automated restarts if needed.

## Key Components:

- **JavaScript Frontend:**
  Battleship's frontend is written in JavaScript, offering an interactive and responsive user interface. Players can engage in the classic battleship gameplay seamlessly through the web-based application.

- **Socket.io and Express Backend:**
