I had the idea to make a platformer game where you draw a path with the mouse and you have to solve levels. This could be a great platformer with nice graphics and integrated physics.

A challenge might be to have a limited amount of ink. The player would have to decide where to use his ink efficiently. There could be multiple types of ink, some with physics, some that are sticky, some that can burn, etc.

This could also make for a great 2 player coop where one player draws and the other controls the character. Imagine yourself on a timer, having to platform through a whole level while your mate is creating last second platforms that you can jump from to reach the end of the level.
