Following up on my previous guitar prototypes [cricket guitar](/post/2018-06-28-cricket-guitar), [skateboard guitar](/post/2016-09-12-skate-guitar) and [cigar box guitar](/post/2016-07-30-cigar-box), I wanted to make a new guitar.I found an old table at the recycling center. It was made of a very heavy hard wood. Taking note from my previous mistakes, I decided to focus on the body and buy a neck. 

The build went well, I used my router and an old electric sander. For the finish I bought some printer ink that I blended in some alcohol and applied to the wood. It makes the grain come out and gives it a nice color.
